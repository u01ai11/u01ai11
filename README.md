### Research Scientist and Software Developer ðŸ‘‹

I build tools to better understand and model human behaviour. 

I currently work as an R&D Scientist at [Cambridge Cognition](https://www.cambridgecognition.com/services/neuroscience-consultancy/alex-anwyl-irvine-phd), where I make new assessments for memory and other cognitive abilities.
